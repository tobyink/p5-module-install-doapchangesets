=head1 NAME

Module::Install::DOAPChangeSets - write your distribution change log in RDF

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package allows you to write your Changes file in Turtle or RDF/XML and
autogenerate a human-readable text file.

To do this, create an RDF file called "meta/changes.ttl" (or something like that)
and describe your distribution's changes in RDF using the Dublin Core, DOAP,
and DOAP Change Sets vocabularies. Then in your Makefile.PL, include:

  write_doap_changes "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle";

This line will read your data from the file named as the first argument,
parse it using either Turtle or RDFXML parsers (the third argument), and
output a human-readable changelog to the file named as the second argument.

The defaults are "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle", so if you name the
files like that, then you can exclude all the arguments and just include
this in your Makefile.PL:

  write_doap_changes;

There's also a line you can use to output a Changes.xml file:

  write_doap_changes_xml "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes.xml", "turtle";

=head2 Integration with Module::Install::RDF

L<Module::Install::RDF> reads all the RDF it can find in 'meta'. If you invoke
Module::Install::RDF before invoking Module::Install::DOAPChangeSets, then 
this module will use Module::Install::RDF's copy of the data.
