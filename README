NAME
    Module::Install::DOAPChangeSets - Write your distribution change log in
    RDF

DESCRIPTION
    This package allows you to write your Changes file in Turtle or RDF/XML
    and autogenerate a human-readable text file.

    To do this, create an RDF file called "Changes.ttl" (or something like
    that) and describe your distribution's changes in RDF using the Dublin
    Core, DOAP, and DOAP Change Sets vocabularies. Then in your Makefile.PL,
    include:

      write_doap_changes "Changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle";

    This line will read your data from the file named as the first argument,
    parse it using either Turtle or RDFXML parsers (the third argument), and
    output a human-readable changelog to the file named as the second
    argument.

    The defaults are "Changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle", so if you name the
    files like that, then you can exclude all the arguments and just include
    this in your Makefile.PL:

      write_doap_changes;

    There's also a line you can use to output a Changes.xml file:

      write_doap_changes_xml "Changes.ttl", "Changes.xml", "turtle";

WHY?
    Why not?
